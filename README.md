# 2D-Particles-and-Gravity

This project used Newton's Law of Gravitation and the kinematic equations to create a physically realistic simulation of planets. It was used also used to visually compare the accuracy of Euler's Method and the accuracy of Heun's Method. 

I wrote an [explanation!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWxRslzsFGU-pi1s-Ta6tdT4iu85y_1lYFjcaytOz5w/edit?usp=sharing) for the beginner interested in building an intuition for the math behind planetary paths and gravity.
